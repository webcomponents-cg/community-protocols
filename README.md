# community-protocols
As the diversity of custom elements grows wider and deeper, so do the benefits of those elements being able to communicate with each other. Making this possible via reusably well-known protocols can enable components not just from X vendor to communicate with themselves, but also to interoperate with components from Y vendor and Z vendor. This project looks to define community protocols for cross-component coordination that reduce the overhead required to make that possible.

Think of things like a context API, async work (Suspense-like), SSR-interop, incremental hydration, etc., many of these capabilities get locked into framework APIs that increase the barriers to interoperability. With a community defined protocol, these features and more become attainable and portable across the web components ecosystem.

## Get involved
Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/webcomponents/community-protocols/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/webcomponents/community-protocols/pulls) currently open on this repo to join in on conversations already inflight regarding a number of exciting areas. If you have ideas on a protocol you like raised to the community open a new [issues](https://github.com/webcomponents/community-protocols/issues/new) so that authors and consumers of libraries and components from across the community that likely have (or wanted to have) implemented features in that area can join in with their use cases as well. Once the rough edges have been hammered out, submit a PR with specs of the protocol and append it to the "Protocols" list below so it can be formalized and put into use across the community.
